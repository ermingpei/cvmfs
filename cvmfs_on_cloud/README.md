CVMFS is
There are different approaches to enable CVMFS on a cloud, either install & configure directly on a running VM, 
or add a Customzation Script when launching a VM, or even apply it to your own cloud image(s). 

Here is the script and the snapshot of the dashboard:

(Note that the above script works only for CentOS/Redhat/Fedora OS flavors. TBD for Ubuntu/Debian/Windows users.)  


Once it's installed and configured, you can test CVMFS with running:

```
$ ls /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca
config  custom  easybuild  gentoo  new_repository  nix
```

or list any other repositories you added to CVMFS_REPOSITORIES variable. 

Now you can run the following command to enable modules from CVMFS:

`$ source /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/config/profile/bash.sh`
